To anybody who is here -- I'm not really following the full [100 Days of Code rules](https://www.100daysofcode.com/rules/). My rules are simply "try to code a little bit every day". Hence, I've renamed this page to `100 Days of Code*`. Because it's 100 Days of Code-ish.

### Day 1: Wednesday, May 12, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Spent most of the time reading through Slack bot documentation. Getting started with Bolt. 

**Thoughts** Going to need to look at pagination, rate limiting, and how to grab all of the users in Slack. I don't think I need the `im:read` permission actually.

### Day 1: Thursday, May 13, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Read through more Slackbot documentation and Bolt documentation. Changed the logic flow to listen from a command.

**Thoughts** I think I do have to use the Events API, and as a result, I'll need to think about deployment and probably sooner rather than later.
