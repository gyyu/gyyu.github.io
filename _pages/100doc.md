### Day 1: Wednesday, May 12, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Spent most of the time reading through Slack bot documentation. Getting started with `bolt`. 

**Thoughts** Going to need to look at pagination, rate limiting, and how to grab all of the users in Slack. I don't think I need the `im:read` permission actually.

**Link(s) to work**
