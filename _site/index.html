<h1>About</h1>
<p>I am a software engineer at Riot Games, and have been there since January 2020. I studied computer science with a minor in mathematical sciences at Carnegie Mellon University, and graduated December 2019. Hopefully out to do good in this world.</p>

<h3>Why does this place exist?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>You are all computer scientists.</p>
<p>You know what FINITE AUTOMATA can do.</p>
<p>You know what TURING MACHINES can do.</p>
<p>For example, Finite Automata can add but not multiply.</p>
<p>Turing Machines can compute any computable function.</p>
<p>Turing Machines are incredibly more powerful than Finite Automata.</p>
<p>Yet the only difference between a FA and a TM is that the TM, unlike the FA, has paper and pencil.</p>
<p>Think about it.</p>
<p>It tells you something about the power of writing.</p>
<p>Without writing, you are reduced to a finite automaton.</p>
<p>With writing you have the extraordinary power of a Turing machine.</p>
<p>– Manuel Blum, <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mblum/research/pdf/grad.html"><em>Advice to a Beginning Graduate Student</em></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>First have something to say,</p>
<p>Second say it,</p>
<p>Third stop when you have said it, and</p>
<p>Finally give it an accurate title."</p>
<p>– John Shaw Billings</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve always loved writing. So there’s a very personal reason why this place exists, which is for my own enjoyment. But there’s also some things that I like to believe I have to say, and perhaps some people out there who might find it mildly valuable. And while I still have that feeling, I’ll keep this place alive.</p>

<h3>Images</h3>
<p>The image used as an icon is my Chinese name painted by my grandmother before she passed away. She did Chinese calligraphy, and I asked her to write my name. This was before her illness worsened, but you can already see the tremors seeping into her strokes.</p>
<p>The image used in the homepage jumbotron is made by David Jin, a very talented friend of mine.</p>

<h3>“just a thermodynamic miracle”</h3>
<p>The tagline from my page is from <em>Watchmen</em> by Alan Moore. It’s from a quote by Dr. Manhattan that I love and has been dear to me through tough times.</p>
<p>It’s a scene where Dr. Manhattan tells Laurie that he doesn’t think her life is meaningless while they are on Mars. It goes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dr. Manhattan: Thermodynamic miracles… events with odds so astronomical they’re effectively impossible, like oxygen spontaneously becoming gold. I long to observe such a thing. And yet, in each human coupling, a thousand million sperm vie for a single egg. Multiple those odds by countless generations, against the odds of your ancestors being alive; meeting; siring this precise son; that exact daughter…</p>
<p>…Until your mother loves a man she has every reason to hate, and of that union, of the thousand million children competing for fertilization, it was you, only you, that emerged.</p>
<p>To distill so specific a form from that chaos of improbability, like turning air to gold… that is the crowning unlikelihood.</p>
<p>The thermodynamic miracle.</p>
<p>Laurie: But… if me, my birth, if that’s a thermodynamic miracle… I mean, you could say that about anybody in the world.</p>
<p>Dr. Manhattan: Yes. Anybody in the world. But the world is so full of people, so crowded with these miracles that they become commonplace and we forget.</p>
<p>I forget.</p>
<p>We gaze continuously at the world and it grows dull in our perceptions. Yet seen from another’s vantage point, as if new, it may still take the breath away.</p>
<p>Come… Dry your eyes, for you are life, rare than a quark and unpredictable beyond the dreams of Heisenberg; the clay in which the forces that shape all things leave their fingerprints most clearly.</p>
<p>Dry your eyes… and let’s go home.</p>
<p>– Alan Moore, <em>Watchmen</em></p>
