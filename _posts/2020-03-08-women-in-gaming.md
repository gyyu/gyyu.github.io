Happy International Women's Day: `a global day celebrating the social, economic, cultural and political achievements of women`!
This is a post I've wanted to write for a while, but it's been hard to focus on. I first wrote a draft where I wanted to talk
about my own experience in gaming after I wrote my reflections on [Riot's culture during my internship](https://gyyu.github.io/writing/career/riot/gaming/2019/12/30/summer-at-riot.html),
and again after Remilia passed away, I felt an urge to write.

But then I'll look at it again the next day and scrap it. It's hard to write about something you care about, because there's simply so much
you want to say and no perfect way to feasibly capture all of your thoughts, emotions, and passion you feel about this topic
also because it's such a dear part of your identity. I remember when I was competing at Princeton University's Adlai Tournament,
a motions tournament in the American Parliamentary Debate Association's circuit, and there had been a topic about
social media and privacy that I had felt so strongly about -- I had done research for two years in this area as well -- but when the time came
for me to give the opening speech, I floundered. It was difficult to take this immense lake of thoughts I had regarding the topic
and distill it into a seven-and-a-half minute speech with any amount of clarity. So, since then, I've been especially cautious about how to talk
about something I am passionate about.

On Friday, I went to the International Women's Day celebration at Riot Games. It hit me hard. I absolutely loved the event,
and the talks I listened to were unexpectantly poignant and resonant. There's no way I could listen to the stories that the women
on stage shared and not feel inspired to add my own piece.

So here goes.

# About Me

your experience in gaming
feeling left out
feeling fit in when you were able to be like one of the boys
quotes from ronnie: when your opinion of your own race is so fucking poor that you believe you are the exception to that rule
it's internalized misogyny
I gatekeep myself, and I refused ot just let myself be an ordinary girl in gaming.

# Zoe, Scarlett, and Remilia

thoughts on some transgender women in gaming
women-only video game leagues
wasn't really something which was talked about w/ trans women until trans women started doing well

I've never used TikTok before in my life. Last December, I was sitting on a bus from NYC to DC,
watching snowflakes go by as the bus idled in outbound Manhattan traffic. Everything was at a standstill.
I texted my father that it looked like we would be arriving a bit late to Union Station.
It was the day before Christmas Eve, and there were other buses stuck on the overpass with their destinations
on their backs: Philadelphia, PA. Boston, MA. Washington, D.C. There were
two boys in the seat next to me, one on a video call and the other slouched over and
scrolling through his phone on TikTok. He'd swipe through them, completely emotionless, and would
elbow the boy next to him to giggle together at a particularly funny video. But creeping on people sitting next to me aside, TikTok has changed a peculiar aspect of my life:
a phenomenon of reclaiming the term, "egirl".

being feminine, being girly, being emotional -- it's a power i feel.

how to be a mentor
instead of defending this niche that you occupy as a girl in gaming, make room for other girls.
