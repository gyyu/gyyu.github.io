### Hi, my name is Grace.

I will start work as a software engineer at Riot Games in late January 2020. I
studied computer science with a minor in mathematical sciences at Carnegie
Mellon University, and graduated Fall 2019. Hopefully out to do good in this world.

### Interests

- Gaming (StarCraft, League of Legends)
- Functional programming
- Machine learning
- Computer systems
- Piano
- Drawing (sketching, watercolor, acrylic, charcoal)
- Singing
- Cooking
- Water rights and the environment
- Reading (book reviews incoming, hopefully)
- Biology
- Writing
- Trying to become an informed citizen of the world

### Current Goals (and Progress)

- Complete the 100 Days of Code challenge
- Read 12 books
  - Finished: Water for Elephants by Sara Gruen (sometime in October 2019). Picked this up
  after my library had a collection of books that had been banned at schools, which intrigued
  me in a defiant manner "You told me not to do this? Fine, I'll go and do it now!". I didn't
  read anything about it going in, but I'm pretty sure it was banned just because of
  some obscenities that is a circus's normalcy -- it's a circus, after all.
  - Finished: The Three Body Problem by Liu Cixin (sometime in November 2019). The background set in
  the Cultural Revolution and the Red Guard had some personal ties to me. I enjoyed it. I also have
  been meaning to read more Chinese literature. I used to always say I'd kill myself in the event of a
  zombie apocalypse, but this book convinced me to try a bit more. What does it take to defy your
  entire biological race? Not sure. But I felt a bit ashamed after reading it for giving up
  so easily on humanity just because it would be pretty stressful and frightening to exist
  during a zombie apocalypse.
  - Finished: Never Let Me Go by Kazuo Ishiguro (11/28/2019). I've heard of this book for a while.
  Never actually picked it up because the name made me feel like it was a sappy teenage romance novel,
  which I genuinely enjoy honestly, but I'm Much Too Old For That (tm) and Grown Up to be reading
  teenage romance novels, so I always skipped over it. Oh my. It's a lot more than that. Pretty interesting
  book.
- Exercise regularly
  - Started rock climbing. I can do some crimpy V4s? Slopers? Ha. Not a chance.
  Working on it.
  - Weight lifting. Have not been good about doing this consistently as of December 2019, and have been
  plateauing at around 100 lbs for squats, 125 lbs for deadlifts, 55 lbs for benches.
- Hit Platinum this season
  - Hey, I hit Gold IV duoing with my friend. I also switched to support. Guess I'm an egirl now. I should write
  about some thoughts on that...

### Current Projects

- Instagram
  - Currently trying to use Instagram to post images of drawings, videos of piano bits, and other attempts
  for me to revisit my childhood hobbies. They won't be good at first, but I think it'd be fun to (one day) look back at the progress.
- 100 Days of Code
  - Progress is on Github
- Doran's Lab

### Images

The image used as an icon is my Chinese name painted by my grandmother before she passed away. She did Chinese calligraphy, and I asked her to write my name. This was before her illness worsened, but you can already see the tremors seeping into her strokes.

The image used in the homepage jumbotron is made by David Jin, a very talented friend of mine.
